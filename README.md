# Retail Sales & Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end data analytics portfolio project** focused on analyzing retail sales and profitability. It is designed to demonstrate practical, job-ready **Data Analyst skills** across the complete analytics lifecycle: data preparation, analysis, insight generation, and business reporting.

The project uses **Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI**, reflecting real-world tools commonly required for entry-level and junior data analyst roles. The analysis focuses on identifying sales trends, profitability drivers, and actionable business insights.

## Business Problem

Retail businesses need to understand:

* Which products and categories drive revenue vs. profit
* How profitability varies by region and time
* Which segments underperform and require strategic intervention

This project addresses these questions by transforming raw transactional data into clear insights and decision-support dashboards.

---

## Key Objectives

* Analyze sales and profit performance across products, categories, regions, and time
* Identify high-margin and low-margin products
* Perform data cleaning, aggregation, and exploratory analysis
* Translate data findings into business-friendly insights
* Build interactive dashboards suitable for stakeholders and management

---

## Tools and Technologies

* **Excel**: Initial data cleaning, pivot tables, and summary analysis
* **SQL**: Data extraction, joins, filtering, and aggregations
* **Python**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data manipulation, and visualization
* **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards, KPIs, and business intelligence reporting
